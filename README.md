# SpritesheetStickerator
This tool takes a pmd style portrait spritesheet and transforms it into a set of 512x images accepted by the Telegram sticker bot.

How to use:
1. Download the desired spritesheet from [PMDCollab](https://sprites.pmdcollab.org/index.html#/) (their rules for allowed use cases still apply even after using this tool)
2. Put the spritesheet in the "input" folder beside the .exe file. If such a folder does not exist, run the program once to create it.
3. Run the program and wait for it to finish.
4. Retrieve your sticker-ready portraits from the "output" folder.
An image will be processed only if the corresponding folder inside "output" does not exist yet.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to unpack the zip file or the program will not work properly.
